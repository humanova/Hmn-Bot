# Hmn-Bot

MAJOR CODE AND LIBRARY OVERHAUL
==
A big part of the source code is rewritten in **December 2019**. This happened due project's dependence on old discord.py library
version (0.16.12). It also needed a major code refactoring for a long time beside library upgrade.

Legacy source code is still accessible in [legacy branch](https://github.com/humanova/Hmn-Bot/tree/legacy).
