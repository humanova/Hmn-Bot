[Intro]
I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying

[Refrain]
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?
Do you see it clearer, or are you deceived
In what you believe?

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

[Chorus]
Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
Making you cry

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Chorus]
Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human; I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
You should go looking somewhere higher

[Chorus]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
